# - Mini game


## Lesson: 
*Select 2 sprites, one is the 'Good guy', the other is the 'Bad guy'.
*The bad guy will move 100 steps, then rotate 15 degrees, and bounce of the edge
*The good guy will be controlled by the arrow keys
*The good guy will start with 5(this can be modified) lives
*When the good guy touches the bad guy, lives are decreased by 1
*When lives are equal to 0, game is over

## What we should learn
*Using control structures, using forever loops and if blocks when checking if good guy is touching bad guy and when checking how many lives are left
*Using variables, lives left will be tracked in a variable
*Using variables in an if statement
*Initializing variables
