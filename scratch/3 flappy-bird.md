# Flappy Bird


## Lesson: 
* Recreate the Flappy Bird game
* Create 'gravity' variable
* Use gravity variable to make bird fall unless the spacebar is pressed, then bird should fly up
* Create pipes, use different costume to represent the different openings in the pipes
* Create clones of the pipe sprite and make them move across the screen
* Use random to pick the costume of the pipe
* When bird passes through a pipe, add one to a score variable
* When bird touches a pipe, end the game
 
## What we should learn
* Using costumes on sprites
* Creating a clone and that a clone is a copy
* Random number, what it is and how to generate one
* Expand variable usage, 2 variables are used, one to control how the bird falls, the other keeps the score.
