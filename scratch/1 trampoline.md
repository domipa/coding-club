# - Trampolines


## Lesson: 
* Use the Cat and Frog sprites.
* Make them each jump on a trampoline at different speeds
* Use a key press to make them stop
* Ask a question and use the answer to the question to create different outcomes

## What we should learn
* Using a control structure, in this case a repeat until block to make each sprite bounce
* Capturing an event to make the sprites stop bouncing
* Collect input from user
* Using the input from user to branch using an if then else block
